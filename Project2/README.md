In this assignment, algorithms for Bandit Problems like GWM, EXP3 and UCB were implemented. Bandit Problems are essentially the sequential allocation problem defined by a set of actions where each action provides a random reward from a probability distribution specific to that action. Three types of Bandits were devised: a game with constant reward, game with Gaussian reward and a game with Adversarial rewards.
