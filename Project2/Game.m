classdef (Abstract) Game < handle
    %GAME This is an abstract class defining a game.
    %   This class defines common functionality for a game. It contains 
    %   member variables that define the number of actions, rounds of the
    %   game and the reward for each action at each round. 
    %
    %   It contains common functions for a game such as retrieving the
    %   reward for an action at a time, cumulative reward of best action in
    %   hindsight, etc. It also simulates playing the game given a policy
    %   object. 
    %
    %   Since this Game class is abstract, it is cannot directly be used. A
    %   concrete class that inherits from this Game class and defines
    %   values for the member variables can be used.
    
    % Member variables of the class
    properties
        nbActions   % number of actions
        totalRounds % number of rounds of the game
        tabR        % table of rewards (nbActions x totalRounds)
        N           % counter for the current round of the game ans(:
